The aim of this project is to build a complete ECG biometric system that processes raw ECG signals, extracts unique features, and uses machine learning models to identify individuals accurately. Our team focused specifically on the feature extraction block, the part of the system that isolates unique characteristics from the ECG signal. By applying signal filtering and different feature extraction techniques, combined with classification models, the system transforms physiological data into templates, digital representations of the users. The project’s modular structure greatly facilitated our work in feature extraction, allowing us to objectively and efficiently test the results of various techniques. With separate modules for each stage, we could focus on feature extraction independently while integrating and testing the module seamlessly with the rest of the system. This approach enabled rapid iteration and comparison of techniques, improving the accuracy and reliability of the extracted features.
